Andal was born in the 8th century CE in Srivilliputhur, a town in Tamil Nadu. She was found as a baby under a tulsi plant by Periyalvar, a devout Vaishnava and a temple priest. He named her Goda, meaning "gift of the earth", and raised her as his daughter. He also taught her the Vedas, the Puranas, and the Divya Prabandham. Andal grew up as a beautiful and intelligent girl, with a deep love for Kannan.
 
Andal had a unique habit of wearing the garland that Periyalvar had prepared for the temple deity every morning. She would look at herself in the mirror and imagine that she was Kannan's bride. She would then return the garland to Periyalvar, who would offer it to the deity without noticing anything. One day, however, he saw a strand of hair on the garland and realized what Andal had been doing. He was shocked and angry, and scolded her for defiling the garland. He then made a fresh garland and offered it to the deity.
 
That night, Kannan appeared in Periyalvar's dream and told him that he preferred Andal's garland to his. He said that he was pleased with Andal's devotion and wanted to marry her. He asked Periyalvar to bring Andal to Srirangam, where he resided as Ranganatha, the reclining Vishnu. Periyalvar woke up and realized his mistake. He apologized to Andal and told her about the dream. He then took her to Srirangam with great joy and honor.

At Srirangam, Andal saw Ranganatha and was overwhelmed with love. She ran towards him and merged with him in front of everyone. Thus, Andal attained the ultimate union with Kannan, which she had longed for all her life. She is believed to be an incarnation of Bhudevi, the earth goddess and one of Vishnu's consorts. She is also known as Nachiyar, meaning "the lady" or "the queen", and Thirukkodhai, meaning "the one who ruled over God". She is revered as one of the twelve Alvars and the only female Alvar. Her works, Nachiyar Thirumozhi and Thiruppavai, are recited and sung by devotees till date.
