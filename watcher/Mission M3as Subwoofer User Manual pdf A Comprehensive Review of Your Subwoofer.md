## How to Set Up and Enjoy Your Subwoofer
  
Setting up and enjoying your subwoofer is easy if you follow these steps:
  
1. Choose a suitable location for your subwoofer. Ideally, it should be placed near a wall or a corner for maximum bass output. However, you can experiment with different positions to find the best sound quality for your room.
2. Connect your subwoofer to your amplifier or receiver using a subwoofer cable. The subwoofer has a line-level input that accepts either a mono or a stereo signal. If your amplifier or receiver has a dedicated subwoofer output, use that. Otherwise, you can use the speaker-level outputs of your amplifier or receiver and connect them to the high-level inputs of your subwoofer using speaker cables.
3. Plug your subwoofer into a power outlet and turn it on using the power switch at the back panel.
4. Adjust the crossover frequency, level control and phase switch of your subwoofer according to your preference and listening environment. The crossover frequency determines the point at which the subwoofer takes over from your main speakers. The level control adjusts the volume of the subwoofer relative to your main speakers. The phase switch aligns the phase of the subwoofer with your main speakers for optimal bass response.
5. Enjoy your subwoofer! You can play your favorite music or movies and experience the deep and powerful bass that the Mission M3as Subwoofer can deliver.
